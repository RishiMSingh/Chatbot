# Chatbot
Stage 1: Chatbot with rule-based and similarity-based component: This submission should consist at least one Python file that implements the chat bot, one AIML file that implements the rules, and one file of pre-defined Q/A pairs in a suitable format (such as plain text or CSV), a conversation log and design documentation. If you wish, you can create more files than that. You can use the Python and AIML files provided on NOW as a starting point, but you should extend and customise them towards your design specification. The entire program might be as compact as 100 lines but can be double that size depending on your programming style and how many features you implement. The similarity-based component should be based on the bag-of-words model, tf/idf, and cosine similarity. The AIML file could be as compact as 80 lines but will probably somewhat longer, maybe even significantly longer depending on the domain you intend your chatbot to be for.
